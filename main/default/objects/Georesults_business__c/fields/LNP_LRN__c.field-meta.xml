    <description>The Local Routing Number (LRN) is the 10 digit telephone number that is used by US Telecommunications Service Providers to route incoming calls to the appropriate End Office Switch that is currently providing the local dial tone services to the dialed 10 digit telephone number. All 10 digit telephone numbers with a Portability Status Code of &quot;0&quot; (indicating that this is not a ported number) will show the same 10 digit phone number in both the Telephone Number field and in the LRN field to indicate that the 10 digit telephone number is currently not in a ported state.</description>

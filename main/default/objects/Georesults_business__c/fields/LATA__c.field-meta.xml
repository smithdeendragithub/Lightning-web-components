    <fullName>LATA__c</fullName>
    <description>Name of the LATA that this business is located in. The Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) is an area defined in the AT&amp;T Divestiture of 1982 where the local telephone company would provide all services that originated and terminated in the same LATA. The long distance companies would provide all services between these LATAs. These restrictions have been almost completely eliminated and now all telecommunications service providers can serve customers in and between LATAs. The LATA is determined by locating this business address, using the latitude and longitude, on the national LATA map.</description>
